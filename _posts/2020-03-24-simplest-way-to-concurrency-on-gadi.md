title:  A simple way of running parallel programs on Gadi

## Description

Parallelism is not easy. There are many ways of structuring a program to make things run concurrently. For example, Python has the multiprocessing library that allows you to use more than one processor when executing code. These libraries are quite complex and debugging errors in the code is difficult. Luckily, for most of the data processing that we do in the group, there is an easier way to achieve paralelism by running multiple independent jobs on Gadi. 

The basic setup for doing this requires a program that accepts input arguments (see argparse library in Python), a PBS script that also accepts the same arguments and a third script to call them all iterating over the range of values for these parameters. This might sound a little bit complicated, so let's see how all this works using a simple example:

Imagine we have a collection of 100 NetCDF files in the `/g/data/xc0/tiles` directory, with names `00.nc` to `99.nc`. We want to compute the mean of the values in each file, saving the output to a text file, which would be `00.out` for the first file.

This is the Python code to compute the mean and save the output, saved in a file named `compute_mean.py`:

```
import xarray as xr
import argparse

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="""Compute means of netcdfs""")
    parser.add_argument('-fname', '--file_name', type=str, required=True, help="Specifies the input NetCDF file.")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    ds = xr.open_dataset(args.file_name)
    mean = ds.NDVI.mean().values

    with open(args.file_name[:-2] + "out", "w") as out_file:
        out_file.write("mean value: {}".format(mean))

```

To compute the mean of file `44.nc` we would do:

```
$ python compute_mean.py -fname 44.nc
```

Imagine that executing this code takes one hour and we want to use the supercomputer. We can write the following PBS script, with name `gadi_mean.pbs`:

```
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -P aa00
#PBS -q normal
#PBS -l ncpus=1
#PBS -l mem=4GB
#PBS -l walltime=01:00:00

python compute_mean.py -fname $fname
```

Note the `$` symbol as a parameter of our Python script. This is an environment variable in Bash scripts and is something we can pass as an argument when calling this script. For example, to submit a job and process the file `44.nc` we can do:

```
qsub -v "fname=44.nc" gadi_mean.pbs
```

Finally, all we need for submiting all our 100 jobs is another script that makes these calls. We can write another Bash script for this but in this case we use Python:

```
import os
import glob

tiles = glob.glob('/g/data/xc0/tiles/*')

for tile in tiles:
    os.system('qsub -v "fname={}" gadi_mean.pbs'.format(tile))
```

Running this code will submit 100 jobs to Gadi and we will have effectivily achieved to run our code in parallel. If you want to try this be carefull with the resources that you request and always test your code before sending jobs to Gadi (printing instead of calling os.system() is a good way). An error in this last script could result in thousands of jobs being submitted and no allocation for the rest of the group.
